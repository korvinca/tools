## Welcome to the Tools, Console and Command-Line repo

This repository contains the source code for:

* **doc** Folder: The documentation folder

* **res** Folder: For all static resources in your project. For example, images.

* **src** Folder: The source code folder! However, in languages that use headers (or if you have a framework for your application) don’t put those files in here.

* **test** Folder: Unit tests, integration tests… go here.

* **tools** Folder: Convenience directory for your use. Should contain scripts to automate tasks in the project, for example, build scripts, rename scripts. Usually contains .sh, .cmd files for example.

* **.gitignore** : List of blobs for git to ignore. Affects commands like git add and git clean.
